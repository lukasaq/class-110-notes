#################### start of Planning Lifecycle #######################
----------------------Planning Lifecycle Overview---------------------------

The first step of the CPT OP is Objectives, Effects, and Guidance. When conditions or requirements trigger a CPT mission, the operational planning section determines the appropriate CPT functions and capabilities before developing preliminary objectives, 


Three possible triggers initiate the CPT operations process:

Threat Intelligence: Threat intelligence reporting or warning intelligence may trigger hunt, clear, enable hardening, and assessment functions by the CPT.

Campaign Plan: CPT employment in support of Combatant Command (CCMD) campaign plans is intended to increase critical asset protection prior to operational need.
  
Malicious Cyberspace Activity (MCA) Detection: Whether discovered by local network protection assets, network owners, or indicated by threat intelligence reporting, CPT hunting and clearing entails conducting reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance on supported commanders’ networks or systems to gain and maintain contact with an adversary or further develop a situation.

Once a trigger has been identified a determination for mission need is required. If a mission is required, a PLANORD and TASKORD is developed. 

-------------------------------TASKORD Overview (1)--------------------------------------------

Planning for a CPT operation begins with the issuance of a PLANORD or TASKORD. The PLANORD and TASKORDs 

  --------------------TASKORD Overview (2)------------------------
Section 2A of the TASKORD defines the intent, purpose, method, and end accomplishment(s) of the task. The Commander’s Intent is the overview of the mission and the applicable actions the CPT takes in the task. The Purpose defines the goals and objectives of the task. The Method defines how the task is executed. The End State defines what constitutes completion of the task.

----------------------Terrain Information-------------------------------

Terrain, which covers all of cyberspace, includes the logical and physical components. When defining terrain, Defensive Cyberspace Operations (DCO) team members should use Key Terrain in Cyberspace (KT-C), MRT-C, Task Critical Asset (TCA), and Defense Critical Asset (DCA) as outlined in United States Cyber Command (USCC) Operational Guidance on Identification of Mission Relevant Terrain in Cyberspace. 

errain analysis is the collection, analysis, evaluation, and interpretation of geographic (physical) and digital (virtual) information on the natural and man-made features of the terrain — combined with other relevant factors — to predict the effect of the terrain on military

-------------------Configuration Information----------------------------

Configuration information refers to the details and settings of the machines and devices used on the network. Configuration information can refer to both physical and logical details and settings. Physical configuration information can include data points such as the location of servers, machines, or network devices and the type of hardware making the connection between machines. Logical configuration information can include data points such as Operating Systems (OS), firmware and firewall versions, and Active Directory (AD) users and groups. Configuration information can also include data points containing the Points of Contact (POC) that are responsible for the configurations.

GENTEXT/EXECUTION/2.


2.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS.


COMMANDER'S INTENT. CPT conducts hunt operations to illuminate the adversary and, when directed, clear the adversary with the support of SCA. In order to identify and characterize the assign terrain, the team assesses the security posture and effectiveness of the security system deployed to increase understanding of defensive postures, validate network assets, and correct local defender's network map, if applicable. Share and assist in synthesizing intelligence on threats, force dispositions and vulnerabilities to secure and defend regional and functional critical information, critical assets, and critical infrastructure/key resources. If an adversary is identified on the network, attempt to identify adversary intentions, collect intelligence, and monitor adversary activity.


2.A.1.A PURPOSE. Identify an adversary presence, if it exists, identify the extent of adversary actions, and create a suggested IR plan. Assess SCA’s DCO posture to identify vulnerability mitigation opportunities and reduce the risk of vulnerabilities. 


2.A.1.B METHOD. The hunt operations include identification and characterization of MRT-C and KT-C, identification of threats to the assigned terrain, and provide mitigation options to enable hardening based on the identified threat. The operation leverages the Intelligence Community (IC), MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, assessments of cyber threats, and potential adversaries — friendly forces — to evaluate the readiness and effectiveness of SCA’s boundary.


2.A.1.C END STATE. Identification of adversary presence and, when directed, clear from the terrain. SCA is provided with a Risk Mitigation Plan (RMP) to improve defenses to degrade adversary ability to maneuver or conduct actions against SCA.

--------------------------Preparing an RFI for Operation 33------------------------------

questions are included and sent to SCA in the RFI:
  Can the CPT develop an Unclassified (UNCLASS) Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) that mirrors SCA’s network?
  Who are the users and users' accesses on the network? 
  How does the CPT communicate end state and findings of the mission?
  What is the process of getting RDP and SSH approved by system engineers and network developers? 

-------------------Who are the users and users' accesses on the network? ------------------------------

Network diagrams often include the physical network layer but do not include the cyber-persona layer. 


The physical network layer consists of the tactile Information Technology (IT) devices and infrastructure in the domains that provide storage, transport, and processing of information within cyberspace. The layer includes data repositories and the connections that transfer data between network components.


The cyber-persona layer is a view of cyberspace created by pulling artifacts and data from the logical network layer to describe actors and entities that utilize the network. The cyber-persona layer consists of network or IT user accounts — whether human or automated — and their relationships to one another.


To assess if user accounts or credentials were leveraged by adversaries, the CPT needs information pertaining to the list of users and their respective accesses on the network. This helps correlate adversary activity, for instance, if an account accessed a portion of the network or a system that it is not expected to access, this could be a sign of the adversary leveraging the account’s credentials. The CPT needs information about the users so they can flesh out the cyber-persona layer of their mission relevant terrain in cyberspace (MRT-C).


----------------------How does the CPT communicate end state and findings of the mission? -------------------------

The TASKORD defines the end state for the operation. Operation 33 ends when there is identification of adversarial presence, clearing the presence from the terrain, and providing SCA with an RMP to improve defenses to degrade adversary ability to maneuver or conduct actions against SCA. The TASKORD and data collection does not answer how end state is communicated and to which SCA personnel. The SCA might expect a certain style of RMP or a presentation/meeting to discuss the findings of the operation.

#################### start of Terrain Identification ###########################

KT-C: Any locality or area — physical or logical — where seizure, retention, or other specified degrees of control provide a marked advantage in cyberspace to any combatant.  

MRT-C: Described as — but not limited to — all devices, internal/external links, Operating Systems (OS), services, applications, ports, protocols, hardware, and software on servers required to enable the function of a critical asset.  

TCA: An asset that is of such extraordinary importance that its incapacitation or destruction would have a serious, debilitating effect on the ability of one or more Department of Defense (DoD) or Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) components to execute the capability or mission-essential task it supports. TCAs are used to identify DCAs.  

DCA: An asset of such extraordinary importance to operations in peace, crisis, and war that its incapacitation or destruction would have a very serious, debilitating effect on the ability of the DoD to fulfill its missions.  

-----------------------Terrain Analysis and Identification----------------------------

Terrain analysis is the collection, analysis, evaluation, and interpretation of geographic (physical) and digital (virtual) information on the natural and man-made features of the terrain

---------------------Terrain Analysis and Site Survey ------------------------------

 Information that can be collected during a site survey includes access to the site and necessary equipment, network topology, OSs, and critical on-site personnel to assist with the operation


--------------------Terrain-based Cyberspace Threat Hunting Methodologies----------------------------

Analytics — Driven
  Analytics — Driven methodology leverages data and analytics. This methodology utilizes complex queries and algorithms to apply to data sets. Often the queries are applied utilizing automation in software.

Situational Awareness — Driven 
  Situational Awareness — Driven methodology leverages an advanced understanding of a particular cyberspace terrain in order to detect anomalous activity. Much like Analytics, Situational Awareness does not require physical access to local     
  systems.

Intelligence — Driven
  Intelligence — Driven methodology leverages timely, accurate, mature Cyberspace Threat Intelligence (CTI) to detect advanced cyberspace threats. Intelligence — Driven methodology requires physical access to local systems. 


--------------------Defining an Operational Environment---------------------------

ployment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. Components including the type of equipment, the size of the network, OSs, key personnel, and schedule of the location all play critical roles in decision making. These components help to define the OE.

Defining the OE results in the identification of: 
  Significant characteristics that can affect friendly and threat operations
  Gaps in current intelligence

--------------------Layers of Cyberspace----------------------------

When defining the OE, start with the three layers of cyberspace:
  Physical network 
            The physical network layer consists of the tactile Information Technology (IT) devices and infrastructure in the domains that provide storage, transport, and processing of information within cyberspace. The layer includes data                  repositories and the connections that transfer data between network components.
  Logical network
            The logical network layer consists of all the data — whether resting, moving, or being used in the physical network layer. The logical network layer is based on the programming or software that drives network communications,                    interactions, and connectivity            
  Cyber-Persona
          The cyber-persona layer is a view of cyberspace created by pulling artifacts and data from the logical network layer to describe actors and entities that utilize the network. The cyber-persona layer consists of network or IT user               accounts, whether human or automated, and their relationships to one another.

###################### start ofDetailed Threat Assessment Report ###############################

-------------------Detailed Threat Assessment Overview-----------------------

detailed threat assessment report is a tool utilized by organizations to properly measure organizational readiness for probable threat actors, based on historical attacks. Detailed threat assessments are granular and can be assembled in preparation of, or after, a security breach.

he goal of a detailed threat assessment report is to identify assets and information that might be affected during a cyber attack. Included in the report is information regarding:

Threat actors
Events
Anomalies
Vulnerabilities 
Assets of interest to be compromised 

-----------------Timeline of Events------------------------

An important feature of threat assessment is a timeline of events. Threat assessment includes investigative findings over a period of time. The assessment takes the findings and plots the points on a timeline. Plotting key points and events on the timeline allows readers to easily see and digest a compromise or attack. 


---------------------------Mapping Detailed Threat Assessment Report Information to Mitre ATT&CK Framework-----------------------------

MITRE ATT&CK is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the various phases of an adversary’s attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target. ATT&CK originated out of a project to enumerate and categorize post-compromise adversary TTPs against Windows Operating Systems (OS) to improve detection of malicious activity. It now includes Linux and MacOS and covers pre-compromise tactics and techniques, and technology-focused domains like mobile devices. 

At a high level, ATT&CK is a behavioral model that consists of the following core components:
  Tactics: Denoting short-term, tactical adversary goals during an attack (the columns)
  Techniques: Describing the means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals (the individual cells)
  Documented adversary usage of techniques and other metadata (linked to techniques)

NOTE: ATT&CK is not an exhaustive enumeration of attack vectors against software.
