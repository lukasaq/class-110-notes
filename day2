  -------------------OSI Model Layers and Devices------------------

OSI model describes and standardizes the functions and characteristics of communications across various devices, media, and abstractly between applications. 


--------------------OSI Layer 2 Devices--------------------

Devices that operate on layer 2 of the OSI model, or the Data Link Layer in the TCP/IP protocol stack, perform switching operations on frames. Each frame contains 
addressing associated with a hardware Network Interface Controller (NIC) (Destination Media Access Control [DMAC] address and Source Media Access Control [SMAC] address)

 common devices that operate at this layer are switches and bridges. Both of these devices include a Media Access Control (MAC) address table, known as a Content Addressable
Memory (CAM) table, that tracks which MAC addresses are associated with each port on the switch. 

Multiple layer 2 devices may be connected together in such a manner that loops could be created. To prevent an overwhelming amount of transmitted frames — also known as a broadcast
storm — most layer 2 devices use a protocol like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to identify themselves to the other devices they may be connected to. 

Layer 2 protocols do not have a Time To Live (TTL) value to indicate when a frame should no longer be forwarded so it is important to ensure there are no loops as a frame could be endlessly forwarded. 

----------------------OSI Layer 3 Devices------------------------------------

Devices that operate on layer 3 operate on packets. These packets are routed between networks

Layer 3 devices separate broadcast domains — or networks. Any device that operates on layer 3 is a router. 


----------------------IP Network Components---------------------------------

IP networks have several components and terms:

- Network Identifier (ID) (also sometimes known as subnet ID): Portion — # of bits — of an IP address that designates the network on which a host resides — also the base IP address in a network
- Host ID: Portion — # of bits — of an IP address that designates the host within its network
- Subnet mask: Mask that specifies which bits are network (binary one) and which bits are host (binary zero)
- Broadcast address: Last IP address within a network that is reserved to address all hosts in the same network
- Gateway (also known as next-hop): IP address assigned to a layer 3 device — router — that connects multiple networks together and can route packets between them
- Default gateway: Layer 3 device used for routing when there is not a more specific gateway specified in the routing table


vast majority of hosts on the internet still use Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and have not yet migrated to the newer Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).

-------------------Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)---------------------

IP addresses can be assigned statically or requested dynamically from a centralized management server. 
DHCP uses UDP over port 67 for DHCP servers and port 68 for clients. DHCP operations fall into four stages

- DHCP server Discovery
- IP address lease Offer
- IP address lease Request
- IP address lease Acknowledgement

------------------IPV6------------------------

IPv6 addresses use 128-bit addresses — represented in hexadecimal notation.

 address space for IPv6 is large enough that the least significant 64 bits are used for hosts on subnets. The most significant 64 bits designate the network — or routing prefix.

IPv6 addresses can be shortened in certain circumstances for clarity and readability:
- One or more leading zeros from a group of hexadecimal digits can be removed (e.g., :0042: is shortened to :42:)
- Consecutive sections of zeros are replaced by two colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329 is shortened to 2001:0db8::ff00:0042:8329)

-------------------NAT/Port Address Translation (PAT) Review--------------------------

NAT and PAT allow networks to use a limited number of public IP addresses to isolate and translate between a private IP addressing space that is
used internally and the public IP addresses needed to communicate with hosts on the internet. 

NAT is intended as a one-for-one private-to-public address translation 
PAT uses a combination of inside IP address and inside source port to build the translation table.
