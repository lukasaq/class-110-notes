Breaking down this test, make note of the input_arguments which start at line 10. Input arguments provide parameters on how the test runs. It contains three entries: filename, regsvrpath, and regsvr32name. The default values generally suffice for testing purposes, but can be customized based on system configuration differences. The filename provided by default — PathToAtomicsFolder\T1218.010\src\RegSvr32.sct — is a scriptlet that runs Notepad (notepad.exe). 


These are the event types maintained by Sysmon when configured with Sysmon-Modular.
